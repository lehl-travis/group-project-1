            <p>Traditionally, the caprese salad calls for sliced tomatoes and slices of mozzarella. This version uses cherry
                tomatoes, and either mozzarella balls or small cubes of the cheese. This gives you a salad that's a bit more
                like a salad, and works better as a side item. In addition, the cherry tomatoes are a bit sweeter, which
                brings a little more brightness to the dish.</p>
            <p>The recipe below is designed to act as a guide, and not something to be followed prescriptively. Play with your
                food! Adjust amounts based on your tastes.</p>
